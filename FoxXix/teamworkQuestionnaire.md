# Teamwork Questionnaire for Brian Martin

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ESFJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I almost always will respond to texts the most efficiently. But with the technicality of these projects, Slack would be best.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope we all learn from each other, having fun creating our project.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I plan to learn how to communicate better through Github and Slack since I don't have that much experience in either.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * We might have trouble trying to get certain issues done, hopefully we can all find time outside of class to work on.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I say always go for the A, there should be no reason to not strive for better.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Each team member should contribute what they can, in an even way.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Like Dave said, an hour a day should be good. Obviously, some days may take up more hours.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will see who is comfortable doing what, or who simply has the motivation to try something new.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I'll cry. But we should all be communicating so we aren't stuck on something, and the team can help out. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We must each respect our opinions.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Once again, we must all respect our habits, but making sure it isn't impacting the quality of our work.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think having a time to meet our of class would be helpful for sure.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * As often as we need. I'm thinking minimum one time a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think we need the majority approval for making the bigger decisions. Github will come in handy for this.. as long as everyone is watching it regularly
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I feel like majority should rule, but we definitely need to respect and hear out the reasons of disagreement. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Make sure what they are doing if for the good of the team and try to not let them dominate it as much.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will let the team know how I feel about it.
