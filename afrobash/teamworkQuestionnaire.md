    What is your personality type?
        ISTP
    Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?
        Reaching me by text is the best way to get a hold of me. But Slack works too.
    What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
        I think we can achieve one of the best projects in class. 
    What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
        I hope to become very familiar with the professional tools we are using and develop good chemistry with my teammates.
    What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
        An obstacle might be my time management skills, I am busy everyday until after 5PM on MWF and 7PM TR.
    What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
        I believe that the A students should get an A and the B students should get a B.
    Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
        I think that the extra work they put in will be rewarded.
    How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
        I think that 5 hours per week is necessary but will change throughout the semester.
    How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
        I think we should volunteer to take on the parts we feel comfortable with and then distribute the rest of the work as a team decision.
    What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
        They will receive a lower grade on the project and the team can talk to TA's but hopefully that's not necessary.
    What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
        If there is an issue about quality among the team then we can talk it through ourselves and find a solution.
    How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
        I think we can all adjust ourselves a little but will mention something at team meetings if we have to.
    Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
        It will definitely help and improve our teams relationship.
    How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
        I believe that once a week is good enough, for a few hours. Twice if necessary.
    Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
        I think yourself and 2 other team members should be good enough. But mention it to the 4th person.
    What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
        There should be a discussion about the disagreement and the decision of the majority of the team after that should have the final say.
    What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
        If he's doing a good job then the team should support him but we should try to all be leaders.
    What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
        I will express my opinion with the team and hopefully come to a solution that will make everyone happy.
