   * I hope to become very familiar with the professional tools we are using and develop good chemistry with my teammates.
5. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__

6. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I believe that the A students should get an A and the B students should get a B. You get what you put in.

   * I think that 5 hours per week is necessary but will change throughout the semester.

   * I think we should volunteer to take on the parts we feel comfortable with and then distribute the rest of the work with a team decision.
10. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * They will receive a lower grade on the project and the team can talk to TA's but hopefully that's not necessary.

   * If there is an issue about quality among the team then we can talk it through ourselves and find a solution.

   * I think we can all adjust ourselves a little but will mention something at team meetings if we have to.
13. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * It will definitely help and improve our teams relationship.
14. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I believe that once a week is good enough, for a few hours. Twice if necessary.
15. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think yourself and 2 other team members should be good enough. But mention it to the 4th person.
16. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * There should be a discussion about the disagreement and the decision of the majority of the team after that should have the final say.
17. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   *  If he's doing a good job then the team should support him but we should try to all be leaders.
18. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will express my opinion with the team and hopefully come to a solution that will make everyone happy.
