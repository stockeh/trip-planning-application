# Sprint 1 - *t10* - *Andromeda*

## Goal

## A team effort to build a simple web application!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a zip of the repo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>1.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we did well | Inital communication | Happy the way we used git and gitHub | Using IntelliJ helped a lot!
What we need to work on | More communication and following through | More commits, and testing for each commit | Get student version of IntelliJ before it expires
What we will change next time | More communication, especially when hitting a wall | More testing! | Have a full storyboard
