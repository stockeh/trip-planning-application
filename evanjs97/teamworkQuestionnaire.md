# Teamwork Questionnaire for Evan Steiner

1. __What is your personality type?__
   INFJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Slack and text and email all work well anytime. If you need to call me night works best.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   I hope we create working application and learn team programming skills along the way.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   I hope to learn how to work better as a team through meetings and gain an understanding of how to work as a team using github.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   We may have differing personal and team goals or conflicting schedules making meetings and/or team programming more difficult.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   We should probably discuss this upfront before starting the project, but I dont see why we shouldnt at least try for an "A".
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   We should divide work evenly and address any issues in this department as they come.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   This will likely vary from week to week, but I imagine averaging 5-10 hours per week should be sufficient.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   We should discuss strengths, skills and interests upfront and divide tasks in an even way.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   We can hopefully communicate well and avoid such incidents. However if this does happen we should follow up with the person in a meeting or over the phone.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   Everyone will have their own opinions of our work and this is ok.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   Everyone has different work habits as well and we should be able to deal with them as long as it isnt hindering team performance/ability to meet deadlines.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   We should definitely have a meeting time outside of class.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   At least once a week, but we could meet much more often depending on our need in a given week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   Depends on how large the decision is. If its a large decision we could try to compromise or decide by majority.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   We should hear that person out and compromise if possible. Otherwise we should decide by majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Talk to them about it and let them know that we want want the whole team to be involved in the process.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Talk to my team about my concerns.
